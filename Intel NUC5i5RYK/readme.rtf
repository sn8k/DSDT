I'm using it as a daily driver ;)

Not tested (lack of hardware to test) :

- DP
- Audio IN
- HDMI Audio OUT

To be tested :
- Bluetooth

Known Issue :
- Sometimes, wifi won't connect, or won't see networks (just do a fresh boot)
- i don't know if it's my router, but Wifi seems slow for file transfer ... to be checked
- Trim wasn't enabled at first on 10.15. After setup, i had to go to terminal and enable it. Not checked on a fresh bigsur 11.1 as i've updated from 10.15
in terminal :
sudo trimforce enable

My Setup :
- intel NUC5i5RYK (Terra PC-MICRO 6000)
- 8Gb RAM / Samsung SSD-M2 256Gb (see upper for trim support)
